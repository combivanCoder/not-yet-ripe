###Purpose
Found the vendor documentation quite lengthy and can see that new versions will need verification. 

And I'll constantly forget how this run package is composed over the period between versions; this script makes it easier to manage.

####Steps
- Download the tresorit_installer.run from https://tresorit.com/download/linux
- Place downloaded file in the same location as this script
- Run this script

####TO-DO
- Allow script param of installer path
- See if I can figure out a way to curl or wget the Tresorit public key
